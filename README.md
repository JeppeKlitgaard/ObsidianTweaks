# ObsidianTweaks

This is a small plugin that implements some features of Obsidian that I believe
should've been (perhaps in the future they will be? ❤️).

## Features

Below is a list of the current functionality that has been implemented.

Note that hotkeys cannot be 'disabled', but they can be set to <kbd>Blank</kbd>.
They are all set to blank by default.

### Hotkeys
| Recommended hotkey | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd> | Copy Current Line(s) Down |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd> | Copy Current Line(s) Up |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> | Select Current Line(s) |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> | Toggle Heading - H1 |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> | Toggle Heading - H2 |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> | Toggle Heading - H3 |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> | Toggle Heading - H4 |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> | Toggle Heading - H5 |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>6</kbd> | Toggle Heading - H6 |

## Philosophy

- By default no features are enabled. You can enable the features you want.
  - Thus all features can also be disabled.
- All code is released into public domain without any requirement for attribution using the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/).

## Why Unlicense?

In case the developers of Obsidian want to just straight copy some code into Obsidian, they can do that without worrying about licensing at all.

**Note that any contributions to ObsidianTweaks will thus also be Unlicensed.**

## Honorable Mentions

I initally planned to contribute to the [Hotkeys++](https://github.com/argenos/hotkeysplus-obsidian) plugin, but since I don't necessarily want ObsidianTweaks to be limited to hotkeys in the future, I decided to make my own.
